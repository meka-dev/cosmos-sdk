# Changelog

- Auctions are keyed by proposer addr + chain ID + height

- Builder API types now include proposer address

- Module query API changed
  - No more ProposerForHeight
  - Proposer response type includes optional staking validator

- Builders are expected to validate requests differently
  - Check Proposer.Validator.IsBonded, IsJailed, etc.

- MaxBytes, MaxGas are enforced -- need to document how


# TODO

- Evidence
  - We do proposer infractions
  - We still need to do builder infractions
    - e.g. when builder's winning segment commitment tx is invalid

- Allow builders to be one-to-many with versioned API URLs

- Builder registration fee?
  - Do we need to charge for builder registration?
